# discovery
One of our goals is to provide new search capabilities. The following is a list of potential features.

## Use cases
* Give me all papers published between 2010 and 2012
* Give me all datasets published between 2010 and 2012
* Give me all papers/datasets published between 2010 and 2012 in Berlin

## Search for datasets
* spatial properties (extract information from geotiff/shapefile)
* temporal properties (extract information from geotiff/shapefile)

## Search for source code
* libraries
* functions
* could be Rehan's task

## Search for hypotheses
* constrain search to hypotheses (effort from the author required)

## Search for research questions
* constrain search to research question (effort from the author required)

## Search for keywords
* constrain search to keywords

## Search for methods
* ?

## Granularity in search

* through interactive elements, find values in plots, lines in code, geometries in maps, annotations in data, frames in animations, etc. and reference them with micro persistent identifiers
